        <h2 class="font-bold text-lg text-stone-900">Can I install a cat flap into existing double glazed unit?</h2>

        <p class="text-md text-stone-900">
            A cat flap cannot be installed into existing double glazing; a new sealed unit has to be manufactured and the hole for the cat flap is cut into the two sheets of glass during manufacture. The glass is then toughened before the two sheets of glass are assembled into the new sealed unit. At Cat Flap Fitters Yorkshire we are experienced Glaziers specialising in pet door installations, and we use manufacturers of new sealed units who work to the highest standards.
